Simple example of Fractal generation using recursive function.

What is Sierpinski Triangle?
>>The Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpinski), also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve, 
is a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller 
equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e., 
it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after 
the Polish mathematician Wac≈Çaw Sierpinski, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries prior to the work of Sierpinski.

    This function draws a Sierpinski triangle.

    :param points: A list of 3 lists, each containing 2 coordinates for the three corners of the triangle.
    :type points: list(list(int))
        :param depth: The number of times to divide each side into smaller triangles.  If this is 0 or less, nothing will be
    drawn and the function will return None.  If it's 1 or more, it'll draw a single triangle with sides that are half as long as `points`.  If it's 2 or
    more, then those triangles will be divided into even smaller ones recursively until `depth` is 0 where they'll all finally be drawn on top of one
    another forming one big equilateral triangle with sides that are twice as long as `points`.
