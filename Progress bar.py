    #Using f-strings and print statement's parameter:
    #\r --> Special escape character that allows to keep writing on the same section of the line (in this case from the beginning)
    #{color + bar + Fore.RESET} --> Sums the Fore color character to create a pretty colored bar on the screen
    #percent:.2f --> The :.xf allows to round to x value of decimal points (2 in this case). It is important, for this script, that the two print statement use the same x value to avoid misprinting
    #{color}{percent:.2f}{Fore.RESET} --> Same as previous but since "percent" is a float it can't be directly added to a string. 
    #                                     To fix this you can either use this sintax or convert it yourself to str by doing {color + str(percent:.2f) + Fore.RESET}

    #i + 1 --> Since indexes start at "0", we add 1 to give the progress value to the first iteration and increase it by one at every following iteration for consistency
    #total=lenght --> Used to calculate the percentage of progress. In this case is the lenght of the list of numbers to factorialize
    #color=Fore.CYAN --> Is the color of the progress bar during the operation
    #complete_color=Fore.GREEN --> Is the color of the bar on completion
