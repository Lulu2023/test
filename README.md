HELPFUL PYTHON SCRIPTS:

This README file provides detailed information about the scripts I have written. These programs were created with an intention to experiment with the language and to solve various problems. I would gladly accept modifications from others which can help improve the code, make it more efficient, or even simplify it.
If you would like to make any comments then feel free to send an email to craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.

Note:
In the scripts, the comments etc., are lined up correctly when they are viewed in [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
